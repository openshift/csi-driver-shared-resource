/*
Some old fashioned comments that describe what we are doing in this golang file.

First, some notes on cardinality:
- 1 share references 1 and only 1 secret currently
- given share related cardinality, many pods can reference a given secret via share CSI Volumes

Second, events.  We process Add and Update secret events from the controller in the same way, so we have an UpsertSecret function.
For delete events, the DelSecret is called.

On the use of sync.Map, see the comments in share.go
